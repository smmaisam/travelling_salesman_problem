# ðŸ§­ Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem. The problem is deceptively simple to state:

> ðŸ’¡ **Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?**

TSP is known for its computational complexity. Itâ€™s classified as an NP-Hard problem, meaning as cities increase, the problem becomes exponentially harder to solve. This has led to research into approximation algorithms and heuristic methods that can provide good, if not always optimal, solutions within a reasonable time frame.

TSP has various practical applications in fields such as logistics, manufacturing, warehousing, and transportation, to name a few.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives of this Notebook

In this notebook, we will explore various methods to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem. We will:

- Implement and compare different algorithms for solving TSP.
- Analyze the performance and efficiency of each approach.
- Demonstrate the use of Python libraries and tools to solve TSP efficiently.

By the end of this notebook, we will have a comprehensive understanding of the Traveling Salesman Problem and the techniques available to solve it, along with practical implementations that you can apply to real-world problems.
